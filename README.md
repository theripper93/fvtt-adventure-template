## Setting up the Adventure

### Chose an ID

The adventure id will be needed in multiple spots, once you have chosen the id (eg `lost-mines-3d`) contact me on discord and i'll create a clone of this repository with the aropriate data setup with the id chosen.

### Clone this repository

Once the repository for your adventure is ready, you'll need to clone it from gihub. It's suggested to use VS CODE for ease of use. Once you cloned the repository, select your foundry modules folder as the target of the clone. If all went well, after restarting Foundry, you should see the Adventure Template in your modules list.
