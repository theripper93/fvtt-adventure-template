## Setting up the Adventure

### Chose an ID

You will need to set your adventure id in multiple spots, for this example let's assume we chose `lost-mines-3d` as our adventure id. When you use this repository as a template, make sure to name your cloned repostiory the same as the Adventure id.

### Clone this repository



After cloning this repository, you will need to set your adventure id in multiple spots, for this example let's assume we chose `lost-mines-3d` as our module id. It's suggested that the repository name matches the module id.

in the `module.json` file, change `"id": "fvtt-adventure-template",` to `"id": "lost-mines-3d",`
for the module to be recognized by foundry, the folder name must match the id. If you have named the repository with the adventure id, this will be done automatically when you pull the repository from github.
